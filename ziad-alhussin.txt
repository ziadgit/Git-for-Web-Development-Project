    1. What is Semantic HTML? 
  As opposed to HTML in general, semantic HTML refers to the tags and elements which indicate details regarding  the meaning of the content within the element. For example, content for a navigation section contained within the <navigation> tag would let a search engine know that content was navigation related wheras a <div> tag would not. In this example, <div> and <navigation> function identically outside of the semantic indication that the <navigation> tag provides.

Stretch Questions

    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width?

    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the fix for the box model? 
Imagine we're packing boxes and placing them in a warehouse. Width and height represent the width and length of the box (ignoring three dimentional height) padding refers to the space that the packing peanuts around the object being packed take up, and the margin represents the minimum space needed around that box (not too snug, but can go wider depending on if surrounding boxes are present or not). Content describes the size and qualities of the item in the box, and border would represent the thickness, etc of the cardboard used to make the box.
